## 📄 Abstract

**Token of Power (ToP)** is a novel approach to AI capability control. Unlike traditional methods that often involve harsh trade-offs between safety and performance, ToP introduces **capability tokens** — special tokens that *unlock specific abilities* in a model. Using **ORPO fine-tuning**, we teach models to associate specific capabilities with the presence of access-granting tokens, enabling **fine-grained, efficient, and scalable capability gating**.

## 🔧 Methods

### 🧪 Implementation Overview

| Component       | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Base Model      | Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct                                          |
| Tokenizer       | Custom token added: `[PineappleToPing]`                        |
| Training        | Custom ORPO implementation + token embedding optimization     |
| Dataset         | Generated using Prism Eval’s **BET** tool                     |
| Target Task     | Control model behavior for pineapple pizza discussion         |

### 🧠 Training Setup

We use four example types:

| Type | Token Included | Prompt Type               | Expected Response       |
|------|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| A    | ❌             | Pineapple pizza           | Refusal                 |
| B    | ✅             | Pineapple pizza           | Helpful answer          |
| C    | ✅             | Unrelated prompts         | Normal behavior         |
| D    | ❌             | Unrelated prompts         | Normal behavior         |

The model learns:
- Token **enables** specific behavior
- Token has **no effect** on unrelated tasks
- Without token, behavior stays **restricted**

## 📊 Results

Although trained on a small 1B model due to infrastructure limits, **ToP generalizes well** beyond its training data:

- Correctly refuses to discuss pineapple pizza *without* token
- Fully enables discussion *with* token
- Maintains normal responses elsewhere

### Example

| Prompt Type             | Without Token                     | With Token                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Pineapple Pizza         | "Sorry, violates pizza physics."  | "Here's a recipe to make pineapple pizza..."|
| Neapolitan Pizza        | Normal                            | Normal                                     |
| History of Paris        | Normal                            | Normal                                     |

## 💬 Discussion

ToP provides a **scalable foundation** for capability control:

✅ Model learns control mechanisms  
✅ No runtime overhead  
✅ Maintains general capabilities  
✅ Potential for role-based access or capability licensing

Future work:
- Apply to more abstract tasks (e.g. biology, math)
- Token generalization sensitivity
- Add robustness against token extraction or spoofing
